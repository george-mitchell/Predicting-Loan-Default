# Predicting Loan Default 

We build a classifier to predict the probability of default for a given loan. We use financial and loan application data of borrowers as features to help predict default.  

## Data

We use loan data from Kaggle that was obtained by Lending Club from 2007-2018, which can be found [here]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club/data]). 

The dataset contains 150 explanatory variables for which we will use feature selection. 

## Libraries and Tools

- Polars for data handling and cleaning. 
- Optuna for model calibration and hyperparameter tuning. 
- Plotly for data visualization. 
- Sklearn for shallow learning models. 
- PyTorch for the deep learning model.
