# Predicting Loan Default 

We build a classifier to predict the probability of default for a given loan. We use loan data obtained by Lending Club from 2007-2017, which can be found on ![Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club/data]). 

The dataset contains 150 explanatory variables for which we will use feature selection.
